# Http parser 
i wrote this as an execuse for writting more object oriented code in C++ also i need this for another project ,
so this is just a small program that i thought its better to seperate from the main project.
# How to use 
- i will provide small exapmles on how you might use this , but its pretty stright forward , a quick read over the source code and you'll get it.
# Disclarmer 
- this is obviously a small and rather simple naive implimentation of said http parser , with that said maybe i will continue to make this better in the future.
